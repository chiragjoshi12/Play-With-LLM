Social sciences give us information about social world of man like, Geography, Economics, Social conditions and institutions, political activities and organisations. Subjects other than history introduce us with social life of present time. While history gives us information about past of human society, with the help of which we know our present. Is it possible for us to know about social life of present time without having knowledge of past? How was man’s life when he had not started using fire? Imagine how must have been life of people without agriculture, roads, transportation, houses etc. History gives us information regarding al such aspects. History takes us to a different world of past. It gives us information about customs and traditions, beliefs, diet and dress of people of different generations. We feel as if we are wandering in some other world.\nYou must be thinking, why should we study about human society of the past. History is not only related with matters of past, but also acts as a rackle with current system. What were our ancestors ? Where did they live ? What did they eat ? History gives us information about many such matters. It informs us about changes that have occured in human life."

They go to ancient places and dig out the houses, coins, bricks, stones, implements, sample of food, bones of man and animals etc. and study them and make us aware about culture of man of that time.\nMan has been wandering from one place to another since ancient times. Many travellers have visited other countries to note life of people there. From the travel details of such travellers, we get information about the history and culture of a country. It includes travellers like, Megasthenes, Plini, Fa-hi-yan, Hiuen Tsang.\nThe researches of archeologists and historians give us glimpse of great civilisation, which flourished in the North-West region on the banks of river Indus. In India, many cities existed more than 4500 years ago. In the same way, it can also be known that many cities developed on the banks of river Ganga and nearby area, about 2500 years ago.\nAll these tools give us information about customs, food, attire, technology and culture of people of that time. By exploring many cities and villages, they have given us information regarding cotton, barley, wheat. Besides this they have also given us information about animals of that time.\nArcheologists are the scholars, who study about past. They categorise the tools found, do researches, collect data from manuscripts, documents, archives and then scribe them in a rigorous way. Archeologist and historians bring past to life."

The Iranians called the Indus river Hindos and the people of Greece called Indus. They knew the East bank of the river as India. We know about the name ‘Bharat’ from Rigveda. A group of people named Bharat came to settle in North-western India. It is from their name, that our country came to be known as ‘Bharat’. This group is also mentioned in the early work of Sanskrit, i.e. Rigveda.\n"

Birth of Jesus Christ, founder of Christianity has been associated with date-line. We call it Anno Domini (A.D.) which means years after birth of Jesus Christ. E.g. 2000 A.D. means, 2000 years after birth of Jesus Christ. Similarly B.C. (Before Christ) means, years before birth of Jesus Christ e.g. 2000 B.C. means 2000 years before birth of Jesus Christ. often is written as CE instead of A.D and BCE is written instead of B.C. \nCE means Common Era. while,\nBCE means Before Common Era\nAs Christianity is associated with most nations of the world, we use the same date-line in India as in many nations.\nIn many cases the word BP is also used, which means before present.\n\nKnow this\nBC - Before Christ\nAD - Anno Domini - Both are Greek words.
